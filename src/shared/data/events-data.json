Dashcam Not Mounted: No, the dashcam seems to be properly mounted.\n4. Dashcam Setup: There's no indication of the driver setting up the dashcam in the images.\n5. Truck speed: The watermark at the bottom of the image indicates a consistent speed of 80 mph. As per the provided limits, this would be legal in the highway scenario (80 mph limit).\n6. Driver's Actions: The driver is overtaking a truck depicted on the right. No evident tailgating, changing lanes, weaving, intersection approaching, parking, reversing, being cut off, or other specific actions are observed.\n7. Dashcam Road-Facing Positioning and Stability: The dashcam is stable and consistently pointing towards the road.\n8. Weather Conditions: The sky is partly cloudy with no precipitation visible.\n9. Road Damage: There is no road damage visible in the images.\n10. Third-Party Involvement: The images show the involvement of another truck on the right, but no other third-party entities are directly involved.\n11. Traffic Violations: No traffic violations are evident in the images, such as a red light or stop sign being run.\n12. Scene Environment: The environment includes a highway setting with clear lane demarcations. No traffic lights, double parking, construction zones, unprotected left turns, or traffic jams are visible.\n13. Light and Road Conditions: The light condition is daylight and road conditions appear to be dry.\n14. Location: The location is a highway.\n15. Responsibility: Without any collision or traffic violation present in the images, determining fault is not applicable.\n\nBased on the images alone, there is no evidence of an incident, and the driving conditions suggest compliance with road safety standards for the scenario depicted. The truck is overtaking another vehicle on the highway at the legal speed limit, in daylight and dry conditions.Description of the video from cabin-facing camera: Analyzing the provided dashcam footage, the following observations were made:\n\n- **Dashcam Mounting Status**: The dashcam is properly mounted throughout the footage.\n- **Cabin Camera Positioning and Stability**: The cabin-facing camera remains stable and properly directed towards the driver for the majority of the time, with brief occlusion by what appears to be a hand.\n- **Driver Distraction**: The driver shows signs of medium-level distraction as he is holding a beverage can.\n- **Phone Usage**: No phone usage is observed.\n- **Eating\/Drinking Activity**: The driver is seen holding a beverage can, indicating drinking activity.\n- **Smoking Activity**: There is no evidence of smoking activity.\n- **Reaching for Objects**: The driver does not appear to be reaching for objects.\n- **Seatbelt Usage**: The driver is wearing a seatbelt.\n- **Driver Drowsiness**: There are no overt signs of drowsiness exhibited by the driver.\n- **Driver looking on the road**: The driver maintains his attention mostly on the road, except for moments when his focus shifts possibly due to interaction with the cabin camera.\n- **Face Occlusion**: The driver's face is briefly occluded by a hand adjusting the camera.\n- **Presence of Passengers**: A passenger is present, seemingly asleep.\n- **Baby Onboard**: No baby is visible in the provided images.\n- **Children Onboard**: There are no children visible in the images.\n\nThe overall assessment indicates that while the driver is adequately focused on the road and wearing a seatbelt, he is engaged in a medium-level distraction due to drinking from a can, which requires attention. The passenger is asleep and not a source of distraction. The face occlusion is minor and does not persistently hinder the visibility of the driver.","video_labels":{"collision":"no","near_collision":"no","dashcam_not_mounted":"no","speed":80,"driver_overtaking":"yes","weather_conditions":"cloudy","3rd_party_type":"truck","light_conditions":"daylight","location":"highway","road_conditions":"dry","driver_distracted":"medium_level_distraction","driver_is_eating_or_drinking":"yes","driver_face_occluded":"yes","passengers_in_the_car":"yes","driver_is_not_looking_on_the_road":"no"},"driver_coaching_feedback":"While you're maintaining good focus on the road and adhering to the speed limit, holding a beverage can is a form of distraction that can affect your reaction time.

Face Occlusion: There is no occlusion of the driver's face.\n\n12. Presence of Passengers: No passengers are visible in the front cabin, but a child seat can be seen in the back, though it is not clear if it is occupied.\n\n13. Baby Onboard: Uncertain. A child seat is visible, but it is unclear if a baby is in the seat.\n\n14. Children Onboard: Due to the presence of a child seat, there may be a child onboard, but it is not possible to confirm with the provided images.\n\nOverall, the driver shows some moments of possible low-level distraction but generally adheres to safety measures, such as wearing a seatbelt.

The dashcam footage only captures the view of the road and does not show the cabin environment, hence it is impossible to assess the driver's actions, attentiveness, or the presence of passengers, including babies or children.\n\n2. Since the camera's perspective does not include the driver or the interior of the vehicle, we cannot report on the driver's use of a seatbelt, any potential driver distractions, phone usage, eating or drinking activities, smoking activities, reaching for objects, signs of drowsiness, or whether the driver's face is occluded.\n\n3. The footage does provide clear evidence of the dashcam's mounting status as the frame is stable, with no evidence of the camera moving or falling; however, without the view of the cabin-facing camera, one cannot assess its positioning relative to the driver.\n\n4. The driver's focus on the road cannot be determined from this viewpoint.\n\nIn conclusion, for an effective analysis pertaining to driver monitoring, the dashcam footage should include both road and cabin perspectives. The current footage is suitable for analyzing road conditions or incidents external to the vehicle only.","video_labels":"{\"collision\": \"no\", \"near_collision\": \"no\", \"dashcam_not_mounted\": \"no\", \"misaligned_dashcam_road_facing\": \"yes\", \"weather_conditions\": \"clear_sky\", \"light_conditions\": \"daylight\", \"location\": \"highway\"}","driver_coaching_feedback":"The road-facing dashcam needs immediate attention to correct its upside-down mounting.

Due to the limited field of view, critical assessments such as driver distraction, phone usage, eating, drinking, smoking activities, reaching for objects, seatbelt usage, driver drowsiness, driver's attention to the road, face occlusion, and the presence of passengers cannot be ascertained from these images. It is imperative that dashcam footage encompasses a broader perspective in order to adequately evaluate these fundamental safety parameters.","video_labels":"{\"collision\": \"no\", \"near_collision\": \"no\", \"dashcam_not_mounted\": \"no\", \"dashcam_setup\": \"no\", \"speed\": 65, \"driver_speed_exceeding\": \"yes\", \"misaligned_dashcam_road_facing\": \"no\", \"weather_conditions\": \"cloudy\", \"damaged_road\": \"no\", \"light_conditions\": \"daylight\", \"road_conditions\": \"dry\", \"location\": \"main_road\", \"driver_blame\": \"no\"}","driver_coaching_feedback":"**Road-Facing Camera Feedback:**\nYou're maintaining good control of the vehicle, but your speed is consistently above the legal limit.

Collision: No indication of a collision occurring from the available frames.\n2. Near Collision: No near-miss incidents can be identified in the images.\n3. Dashcam Not Mounted: Yes. It seems the dashcam was not properly mounted as the camera angles are inconsistent and erratic.\n4. Dashcam Setup: Yes, the images suggest the driver might have been setting up or adjusting the dashcam during the captures.\n5. Truck Speed: The speed watermark cannot be clearly extracted from the images due to the camera's positioning and blur. Therefore, compliance with speed limits cannot be assessed.\n6. Driver's Actions: No specific actions such as turning or changing lanes can be confirmed due to the poor camera angles and instability.\n7. Dashcam Road-Facing Positioning and Stability: No. The dashcam was not consistently pointing towards the road and showed signs of instability.\n8.

Location: The location cannot be identified; however, some images might suggest highway driving from the glimpses of road signage and relatively high speed observed in some frames.\n15. Responsibility: Cannot be determined due to insufficient visual evidence.\n\nThe analytical report is severely limited by the improper mounting and handling of the dashcam, which resulted in a lack of clear road-facing images. No concrete conclusions can be drawn regarding the driver's adherence to safety norms, road conditions, or environment without stable and consistent footage.Description of the video from cabin-facing camera: Based on the provided dashcam images, it is not possible to conduct a thorough and detailed environment analysis or driver monitoring. The images are obscured, lacking clear visibility of either the road or the cabin area, hence making it impossible to assess the driver's actions and attentiveness or any environmental conditions.

There are no passengers, children, or babies visibly present in the vehicle. No high-level distractions are observed in the footage. While the specific actions of the driver are not entirely clear due to the frame rate and angle of the footage, there are no immediate signs of dangerous behavior or serious distractions. However, the assessment of drowsiness or distraction levels would benefit from a more comprehensive recording, including the driver's facial expressions and eye movements.","video_labels":"{\"collision\": \"no\", \"near_collision\": \"no\", \"speed\": 38, \"dashcam_not_mounted\": \"no\", \"misaligned_dashcam_road_facing\": \"yes\", \"driver_speed_exceeding\": \"yes\", \"misaligned_dashcam_cabin_facing\": \"no\", \"driver_face_occluded\": \"no\", \"driver_is_using_the_phone\": \"no\", \"driver_is_eating_or_drinking\": \"no\", \"driver_is_smoking\": \"no\", \"driver_is_reaching_for_objects\": \"no\", \"driver_is_unbuckled\": \"no\", \"passengers_in_the_car\": \"no\", \"baby_in_the_car\": \"no\", \"kids_in_the_car\": \"no\"}","driver_coaching_feedback":"Based on the cabin-facing footage, it's good to see no immediate distractions such as phone use or eating.
